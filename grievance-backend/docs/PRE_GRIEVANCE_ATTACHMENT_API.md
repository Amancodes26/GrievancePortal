## Usage Flow

### Complete Workflow: Upload Attachments â†’ Create Grievance

1. **Upload Attachments First:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/pre-grievance/upload-attachment" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>" \
  -F "attachment=@/path/to/your/document.pdf"
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "attachment_id": 123,
    "filename": "pre_grievance_41522026_1703123456789_abc123_document.pdf",
    "original_filename": "document.pdf"
  }
}
```

2. **Upload Another Attachment (Optional):**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/pre-grievance/upload-attachment" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>" \
  -F "attachment=@/path/to/your/image.jpg"
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "attachment_id": 124,
    "filename": "pre_grievance_41522026_1703123456790_def456_image.jpg",
    "original_filename": "image.jpg"
  }
}
```

3. **Create Grievance with Attachments:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/grievances" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "subject": "Exam Schedule Issue",
    "description": "There is a conflict in the exam schedule...",
    "issue_type": "academic",
    "attachment_ids": [123, 124]
  }'
```

The system will automatically:
- Validate that the attachment IDs belong to the authenticated user
- Link the temporary attachments to the created grievance
- Update the grievance record to indicate it has attachments

## Error Handling

### Common Error Responses

**Authentication Required:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Authentication required. Please provide valid JWT token"
}
```

**Attachment Not Found:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Temporary attachment not found or access denied"
}
```

**File Validation Errors:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "File validation failed: Invalid PDF file format"
}
```

**Rate Limiting:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Too many upload attempts. Please wait before trying again"
}
```

## Security Features

1. **JWT Authentication:** All endpoints require valid JWT tokens
2. **File Type Validation:** Only allowed file types are accepted
3. **File Size Limits:** Maximum 5MB per file
4. **Malicious Content Detection:** Files are scanned for suspicious patterns
5. **Rate Limiting:** Maximum 10 uploads per 15 minutes per user
6. **Access Control:** Users can only access their own attachments
7. **Secure File Names:** Generated filenames prevent path traversal attacks
8. **Automatic Cleanup:** Orphaned attachments are automatically removed after 24 hours

## File Storage

- **Development:** Files are stored in `uploads/pre-grievance/` directory
- **Production (Vercel):** Files are converted to base64 and stored in the database
- **Temporary Storage:** Attachments are marked as temporary (Issuse_Id = -1) until linked to a grievance

## Integration with Grievance Creation

When creating a grievance, include the `attachment_ids` field with an array of attachment IDs from the upload response:

```json
{
  "subject": "My Grievance Subject",
  "description": "Detailed description...",
  "issue_type": "academic",
  "attachment_ids": [123, 124, 125]
}
```

The grievance creation endpoint will:
1. Validate all attachment IDs belong to the authenticated user
2. Link the attachments to the created grievance
3. Update the grievance attachment flag
4. Return the grievance details with linked attachment information

## Rate Limits

- **Upload Endpoint:** 10 uploads per 15 minutes per user
- **Other Endpoints:** No specific limits (general API rate limiting applies)

## File Cleanup

Temporary attachments are automatically cleaned up:
- **Manual Cleanup:** Use the `/cleanup` endpoint
- **Automatic Cleanup:** Attachments older than 24 hours are removed
- **Grievance Creation:** Successfully linked attachments are no longer temporary
